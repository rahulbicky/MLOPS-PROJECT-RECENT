1. Class and object(example)
2. Class has data / attribute and function/methods
      >code walkthrough
      >attributes get called itself , methods are called manually
3. Why python is called oops??  -- Everything in python is an object (data structure ,data type etc)
4. Advatages:- 
  > you can create your own datatype 
  > code reusabiltiy
  > debugging
  > easy to colab


5. End to End Project(chatbook class)
  > function vs method
  > encapsulation 
  > getter and scatter
  > static methods
  > inheritence
  > Inheritence code example 
  > why inheritence is needed ??(code reusability , parent has no access to child class)
  > what gets inherited ??--constructor , non private attributes , non private methods 
  > super keyword(can be used only inside  class ,cannot access variables /attributes ,used only inside child class )
  > types of inheritence --1. single inheritence 2. multilevel 3. heirarchical 4. multiple <diamond problem> 5. hybrid
